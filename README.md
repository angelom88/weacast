**This is a WIP, not yet ready for production use**

This short video demonstrates how Weacast can be used to gather forecast data from different models to visualize and predict wind in different locations

## Documentation

The [Weacast docs](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/) are loaded with awesome stuff and tell you everything you need to know about using and configuring Weacast.

## What is inside ?

Weacast is powered by the following stack:
* [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) on the backend side
* [Quasar](http://quasar-framework.org/) on the frontend side

If you are not familiar with those technologies and want to develop for Weacast, in addition to read the dedicated documentation, I recommand reading https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial. Indeed, Weacast itself is a template web application based on the [Quasar wrapper for Feathers](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-wrapper-feathersjs-api), while Weacast plugins are [Feathers plugins](https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/advanced/creating-a-plugin.html).
